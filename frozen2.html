                      <p class="mb-30">I want to start this off by saying I love animated movies, especially from Disney. I'm a Disney fanatic! I watch so many YouTube videos and listen to so many podcasts about their movies. Walt Disney Animated Studios is like, the king of animation. I get it. I loved Frozen (2013). I was one of those people that ran "Let It Go" into the ground and I have no shame about it.<br /><br />Now. The sequel.<br /><br />Avid movie watchers are suffering through a lull in Hollywood full of sequels and prequels and spinoffs. Very few good original movie ideas are hitting blockbuster numbers these days. Frozen 2 is yet another money-hungry sequel that appeared despite&nbsp;<em>nobody</em>&nbsp;asking for it. The orginial Frozen movie ended in a complete tale. A whole story arch that lives its entire life within the hour and fourty-nine minutes of the first movie. This was even apparent to the writers of Frozen 2, seeing that they pulled this entire storyline completely out of thin air with no connection or continuity with the first story.&nbsp; Because this story was so unnecessary, it turned out to be mediocre-at best. And I hate it. Here's why.</p>
                      <h4>#1. The Entirety of Anna's Character and Everything To Do With Her</h4>
                      <p class="mb-30">Most simply put - Anna was BY FAR the most annoying part of this movie. What used to be a strong, caring, somewhat independent character was thrown to the wind and took a backseat to Elsa(I'll get more into this later). Half of Anna's dialogue fell into this annoying, overprotective, clingy sister trope. "That's my sister!" "We're sisters!" "We do this together!" UGH! I get what the writers were going for - the sisters are finally united as one force after the tramatic experiences of the first movie but JEEZ! MUST it be said out loud every 15 minutes? I recently rewatched this movie with my roommates to give it another chance and I took a count of how many times Anna said something that fell into this trope and the final tally was 13 times. THIRTEEN! We get it Anna! And if that wasn't enough, they gave her the worst songs of the entire movie. "The Next Right Thing" is easily the worst song of the franchise. I've tried to listen to it so many times and I'm not sure if I actually hate it or if my hate for Anna is just spewing over into the song, but either way, it sucks. "Some Things Never Change" was also terrible. Horribly boring foreshadowing and simple a plot device (hehe) on a long list of plot devices in this movie. I could rant about Anna for a long time but I'll stop here.</p>
                      <h4>#2. The Magic Doesn't Make Sense</h4>
                      <p class="mb-30">I know you're probably saying "It's magic, it's not real!" and you're right. But even within their world, where magic IS real, NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE! Nothing is ever really explained, and the audience is just supposed to accept it. Now you're probably saying "but it's a kids movie!" Au contraire - that's what they want you to think. This movie was made for the people that were young when the first one came out. All of the jokes are significantly aged up. When watching this movie in theaters, I constantly found myself thinking, "wow that joke will go over kids' heads." Those writers are very much aware who their real audience is but they're hiding behind the mask of being a "kids movie" to avoid having to work too hard on the plot (since they clearly spent the entire budget on the amazingly detailed animation).<br />Here's my problem. They face so many magical obstacles and Elsa gains so many magical powers that are never questioned or explained by anyone! That whole "water holds memory" thing? WHATEVER! Can anyone say "plot device"? Those statues that Elsa accidently creates in the forest (their parents, the horse, etc) make no sense! Or when Elsa freezes but sends that ice image to Anna? Is no one going to question her sudden, new found ability to send these messages? When did she learn how to do that? Or what about everything on the boat? Just thinking about this again makes me so mad.</p>
                      <h4>#3. Everyone Was Constantly Jumping to Ridiculous, Convenient Conclusions</h4>
                      <p class="mb-30">I think this would work best with a list of a few ridiculous conclusions that people jump to.<ul><li>Anna every time she and Kristoff speak - the basic crazy girlfriend trope jumping to basic, crazy girlfriend conclusions (special shoutout to when Kristoff went off to set up a proposal and Anna assumes he abandoned her and doesn't look into the situation any further, effectively abandoning him)</li><li>Anna and Elsa immediately know&nbsp;the frozen statues in the forrest that Elsa created were "moments frozen in time" when they easily could've just been statues</li><li>Anna and Elsa assume&nbsp;the ship they found HAD to belong to their parents even though prior to that moment, they belived the boat had crashed somewhere COMPLETELY different. Why do they not even consider the possibility of it being some other abandoned Arendellean boat?</li><li>Anna immediately knows&nbsp;exactly what the ice message at the end meant and where it came from, without hestiation or context, then goes on&nbsp;to decide the ONLY way to fix the problem was to destroy the bridge even though the image didn't even include the bridge. And of course the only way to destroy the bridge would be to risk her own life by waking and aggravating the rock spirits.</li></ul><p>You know...I'm sensing a pattern here...</p>
                      <h4>#4. No One Matter Except Elsa</h4>
                      <p class="mb-30">At some point or other, everyone is kicked off screen so the writers don't have to figure out how to work them into a movie about Elsa. Kristoff suffered this the most, as he was demoted to only a plot device of transportation for everyone. Without Sven, Kristoff would serve absolutely no purpose. They had to give him the whole engagement storyline just so he has some lines and a reason to be abandoned temporarily in the middle of the movie, never to be seen again until Anna needs him to&nbsp;<em>transport</em>&nbsp;her to the bridge. And if that's not enough, Elsa PHYSICALLY pushed Anna and Olaf away from her journey because they would've served no purpose. So many characters were introduced and named(e.g. Ryder and Honeymaren from Northuldra) but only appear for five minutes! They were really sweet and I would've loved to see them more.</p>

                      <p class="mb-30">These four reasons really sum up my feelings about this movie. I really, really don't like it.</p>
